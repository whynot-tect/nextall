      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. To be eligible for a return, your
        item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original packaging
        and you need to have the receipt or proof of purchase.

        Refunds
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will
        immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method of payment). You
        will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
